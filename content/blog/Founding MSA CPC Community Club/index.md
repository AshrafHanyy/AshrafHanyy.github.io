This is the achievement I'm most proud of during my four years at university.

I want this blog post to be a place where the story of how I founded this club is shared publicly for the first time. In order to start telling this story from my point of view, let's go back to before the Fall 2022 semester started.
# Pre-Fall 2022

Over the summer break, one of my close friends studying computer science at NU shares his certificate for participating at the ECPC. I saw the ICPC logo and I recognized that logo from some popular YT videos I saw of people solving problems online and saying it's for the ICPC. I sent him asking what's the story behind this certificate, he replied telling me all about the ECPC, that it's held annually, that he is able to participate with a club that has been established for many years at his university.

I immediately checked the list of clubs my university offered students, only to find out that the ICPC community club at my university simply doesn't exist. This made me wonder if I even picked the right university. 

I was and still very much am, deeply disappointed that no one cared to establish such a club or train the students to participate at the ECPC on a large scale before. It was sad to see that in order to participate, I would, first, have to make this competition a known thing and try to market it since no one knew what this was. I was told that there was a single TA that trained students before and participated, but she left the university like 3 years ago after participating for 2 consecutive years.
# Fall 2022

First week of the semester, I scheduled a meeting with the vice-dean. On the day of the meeting, first time talking to him, I told him how we needed to participate at the contest and that almost all of the schools that taught computer science across the country participated and it's very bad that we didn't. He welcomed the idea fiercely. He told me that there was another senior student, Mohamed Alaa, that asked for the same idea to be implemented before but for some reason they didn't follow through with the idea. He then asked me if I could, after contacting Alaa, gather some students for this initiative to start. I told him I could but who would give the training?

He asked me to follow him and we stood up and walked to an office, knocked and he entered to Dr. Islam ElSharaawy. This was the first time I met Dr. Islam. Later on, I discovered that Dr. Islam was known to be the smartest engineer on campus. The vice-dean then continued to greet him and told him about my idea to participate. Dr. Islam welcomed the idea and said he could provide the training.

And so we did, Alaa and I became the president and the vice president of the community, respectively. And we gathered over a 100 student to begin the training.

Throughout the first year, the training was very chaotic and very disorderly, Due to the fact that no one was assigned the full responsibility of planning effectively for the sessions and the students themselves were not highly motivated or committed.

The community grew step-by-step. But since this was the first year for this to take place. No one knew what this was.
The registration for the ECPC begin in May, Alaa took care of almost everything regarding the registration.

Eventually, we ended up participating at the ECPC 2023!

# Fall 2023
The start of a new academic year, or as we call it in CPC, Season 2.

Alaa had graduated. And now, I was left alone. Tasked to convert the community to an official student activity (a club). This involved a lot of tasks that I had no experience in. 

I had to recruit students to handle our branding & media, hire a graphic designer to create our logo, draft all the required papers and have them signed, develop a training a plan with Dr. Islam and finally, recruit a new vice president.

For the logo, I hired a professional graphic designer who was a friend. He did an okay job.

For our media, I knew a classmate who was the head of media at a very prestigious club at the university, Omar Ahmed. I called him and he agreed. Later on, he founded our visual identity completely on his own. The whole media team at our club did the best coverage possible and were all remarkable. They helped CPC gain the attention it did when it first started.

For our training plan, I let Dr. Islam handle that.

For the vice president, I heard about this senior student who was known to be very good at organizing faculty events. I called her and luckily she agreed. Later on, I found out that this was a bad decision as she was always busy with her graduation project and therefore, didn't have much time to provide any input.

Once all was done, I submitted the papers to the student activities department and a week later, before the start of the semester, I got a notification that our community is now an official club at the university.

# Fall 2023

The first 3 weeks were dedicated to recruiting students to the club. And the first session held was an orientation session.

On the 4th week, Dr. Islam gave the first lecture session which was a huge success with high turnout rate.

After the midterm exams were over, one of our best technical mentors, Baraa Hekal, spoke to me about how the training was going too fast and that most communities gave the training in a different style than ours. He proposed a change of plans regarding the training and I thought it was correct to approve it since most communities were giving out their training in a different style and since this was coming from a highly skilled competitive programmer.

This proposed change meant that we would had to start the training from the beginning. That, for whatever reason, really did upset Dr. Islam at that time, so much that he never held another lecture session and told us to continue on our own with him in the background as our guiding mentor.  

And so we did, we finished off the entire season by giving out sessions through our technical mentors (experienced students). This made us self-sustainable to some point, which was what Dr. Islam wanted initially. But it wasn't anywhere near the level of technical quality we had hoped for; since the top competitive programmers available weren't very experienced themselves. They had just started.

And so, once I realized we needed help, in December, I contacted Nile University's ICPC Community to see if they could collaborate with us. 

NU ICPC Community Club President, Omar Morshdy, replied back to me and agreed to come to MSA to give two sessions. This was one of the best things I was able to do as president of MSA CPC Community Club. Because regardless of the sessions, just being able to give our students exposure to students from NU's ICPC Community and to get to know these highly experienced competitive programmers from a professional community was a great achievement in itself.

Anyways, before we traveled to the ECPC, I was informed that Dr. Islam had resigned from the faculty.  This would mean I would have to convince another instructor to travel with us as our supervisor. Eventually, we settled with another instructor as our temporary supervisor. 

As the registration for the ECPC started, the entire registration process was done by one person this time, me. 

I created four separate forms, sent them out, collected all the data for 28 teams, created teams for those who were looking for a team (matchmaking), signed the papers and got the approvals. I can say that doing so alone was one of the most remarkable things I am proud to have done. Because eventually, on the day to Alexandria, when I saw the three buses waiting for us, I couldn't have been happier.

Another funny thing I did, when we arrived to Alexandria, I contacted a restaurant to send me their menu as pdf and I sent it to the community group, telling them to pick their food. Keep in mind, this was a restaurant I had only contacted ON THE SAME DAY, and I didn't even agree with the bus drivers yet that we were going to do this. We actually did end up all eating there!

After returning from the competition, I knew it was time to ensure a smooth transition for the club's leadership. I reached out to Dr. Farid Ali, a respected faculty member, and successfully convinced him to become our new Academic Supervisor, recognizing that his guidance would be crucial for the club's continued growth.

Once Dr. Farid was on board, I began the process of transitioning the presidency to the new leader. I carefully selected a successor who I believed had the passion and commitment needed to lead the club. To ensure they were fully prepared, I spent several weeks mentoring them, sharing my experiences, and walking them through the responsibilities that came with the role. I introduced them to key contacts and provided them with detailed documentation on the club's operations, from organizing training sessions to managing logistics for competitions.

During this period, I made sure to stay closely involved, offering support whenever needed and answering any questions that arose. My goal was to ensure that the new president felt confident and equipped to lead, while also allowing them the space to bring in their ideas and make their mark on the club.

As I officially handed over the presidency, I transitioned into the role of a general consultant. This allowed me to stay connected to the club while giving the new leadership flexibility to steer the club in its new direction. I would continue to offer guidance and advice, particularly during critical moments, but my focus would be on empowering the new team to lead with confidence. This transition marked the beginning of a new chapter for both the club and me, as I finally, left MSA CPC Community, a rising star among the students. 

I'm happy with what I have accomplished for MSA CPC. I think I have done everything I could have possibly done to give members of our community the learning experience they deserve.
