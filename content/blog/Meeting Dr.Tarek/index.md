The one thing I never expected when this story first started is that I would meet the former minister of education.
So here it is, in-detail, the full story behind how it happened.

### Education 2.0
On a random day in August 2023, I saw this documentation and research project being. It aimed to document all the education reform the country went through during the period from 2016 - 2022 (The Regime of Dr. Tarek Shawki). And since I was from the first class that went through this reform and was a huge admirer of the new system that completely changed Thanwya Amma. I liked the idea of documenting it very much especially since it aimed to document it such that other developing countries could learn from our experience. The social anthropologist, professor of education, and the director of this research, was Dr. Linda Herrera from UIUC.

### The Post

Anyways, I wanted people to know about this and so I posted about it. Telling people to check out this project. I honestly never expected anything to come out of this post. Anyways, the next day she sent me a message thanking me for posting about it. It was nice of her and I admired the appreciation of such a small gesture. I messaged her back and we talked about the project and I told her that I was Thanwya Amma’s 2018 Class that first went through the new system. Having learnt this, she asked me to do an interview to document my experience from the students POV.

I agreed and we arranged for it. Two weeks later she came to Cairo and we actually met.

### The interview

My interview with her lasted for two hours. I am a huge psychology reader. I have my opinions and I shared them all with her. I can honestly say that talking with an educated social anthropologist was, last thing I thought, a much needed talk. 

We agreed on how things were, psychologically, for all students. She told me about how some students cheated. I told her I knew that people cheated yes, but it didn't have as much to do with the students morality as much as it had to with the system that made the exam for them a bottleneck to live. 

She then questioned on what do I mean by "bottleneck to live". To which I illustrated that there's too much pressure underlying this exam. Most students think that if they don't achieve high grades, they will end up in a bad school, then a bad job with a bad salary and eventually will live a miserable life. And so it is not their morality that is being questioned but rather it is the exam that is triggering their basic survival instinct. 

Anyways as I don't wish to bore the reader with my full psychological analysis of the situation back then. Let's just say I had some very well formulated opinions (according to her)

### First Contact 

Towards the end of the 2 hour long interview, I told her about my research in education. And how that it was inspired by Dr. Tarek's approach to insert technology in education (since my research was about using TUIs in higher education).  I told her that I had always wanted to share these thoughts and opinions with him one day. 

She replied to this saying that she could arrange a meeting, to which I was surprised to say the least, and quickly took out her phone and sent a voice message to Dr. Tarek saying this:

>Good Morning Dr. Tarek,
I met today this brilliant young man who I think you should meet. I want to touchbase on when would you have time to meet with him. I think you would like talking with him and he's very excited to meet you as well. Let me know when you would have time.

Then she gave me his number and told me to send him a text to arrange the meeting.

Needless to say, I was a bit in shock when all of this happened.
