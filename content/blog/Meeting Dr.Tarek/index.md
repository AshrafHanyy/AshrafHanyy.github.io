The one thing I never expected when this story first started is that I would meet the former minister of education.
So here it is, in-detail, the full story behind how it happened.

**Education 2.0**


On a random day in August 2023, I saw this documentation and research project being. It aimed to document all the education reform the country went through during the period from 2016 - 2022 (The Regime of Dr. Tarek Shawki). And since I was from the first class that went through this reform and was a huge admirer of the new system that completely changed Thanwya Amma. I liked the idea of documenting it very much especially since it aimed to document it such that other developing countries could learn from our experience. The social anthropologist, professor of education, and the director of this research, was Dr. Linda Herrera from UIUC.

**First Contact*
Anyways, I wanted people to know about this and so I posted about it. Telling people to check out this project. I honestly never expected anything to come out of this post. Anyways, the next day she sent me a message thanking me for posting about it. It was nice of her and I admired the appreciation of such a small gesture. I messaged her back and we talked about the project and I told her that I was Thanwya Amma’s 2018 Class that first went through the new system. Having learnt this, she asked me to do an interview to document my experience from the students POV. 
I agreed and we arranged for it. Two weeks later she came to Cairo and we actually met.
