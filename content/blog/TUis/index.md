There is a lot of interest in employing tangible user
 interfaces (TUIs) to enhance teaching programming, but there is
 conflicting evidence for their advantages since implementing them
 in educational settings offers more difficulties than traditional
 learning. This paper examines the effect of using TUIs in learning
 and compares it to traditional learning methods. The study
 measures the difference in learning rate on university students
 majoring in computer science. The study was conducted on 20
 university students aged 17 to 22 who participated in a 45-minute
 learning activity. The activity used a Tangible User Interface
 (TUI) and paper notes from a textbook. Pre-test and post-test
 results were collected as part of the studyâ€™s between-groups
 design, and the TUI group outperformed the traditional learning
 group in terms of learning gains. The TUI group had an increase
 of 25.4% in their scores following the three learning sessions and
 a 1.5% decrease when the retention was measured two weeks
 later. The traditional paper learning group had increase of 9.1%
 in scores and a decrease of 7.2% in retention.
