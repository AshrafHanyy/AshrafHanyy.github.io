 For me, this year was unbelievably rewarding. I went through many achievements and reached a lot of milestones that I honestly thought would take me forever to ever get to. I keep reflecting everyday on how I feel about all of this. Although I'm very grateful for every single award and proud of all these achievements. I wanted to reflet a bit on how all of this made me feel eventually. 

Throughout the past year I:
1. Got awarded for best Web Development course project
2. Got awarded for best Computer Organization course project.
3. Got awarded for best Sophomore Class project overall.
4. Scored 5th place at the university's hackathon.
5. Published a research paper in HCI.
6. Founded a community club for Competitive programming.
7. Secured my first internship at NBE.
8. Secured a freelance position to develop a company's website.
9. Met the Minister of Education.
10. Organized the school's participation at the ICPC..


### The Psychological Effect It Had on Me.

Starting the 22/23 academic year from Fall 2022 Semester, I was going through a lot. I don't feel the need to explain what happened to me on the blog here but let's just say that I was suffering quite hard and things felt quite dark. I went through a traumatic phase that eventually left me suffering with PTSD that took almost 11 months to recover from.

It was only through that hardship that I decided to pull everything together and focus on one thing which was studying. At that time, I did nothing but study 24/7. I isolated quite a bit . And from there...things got to a really good point. 

Solzhenitsyn, a Russian author and Soviet dissident who helped to raise global awareness of political repression in the Soviet Union, especially the Gulag prison system, talked about when he was in the camps, that at least if he was laying bricks in a wall, or a bricklayer was doing so, at least he had the satisfaction of building something, there was some tiny iota of meaning in the work, something redemptive in that, a crumb of meaning that you could feast on in the midst of your starvation. 

### Per Aspera Ad Astra

When I first learned that Idea, I thought about it for a long time. I thought that this could be my antidote. That the only way out of any suffering was to allow yourself to have some hope. Although it seems paradoxical but it is true. Also, there's one advantage to specifying darkness to that extent, it is that when you specify something that precisely, you are also specifying it's opposite, so if you are living to a great extent in horrible suffering and darkness, then, at least in principle, there exists the opposite of that. So while I was looking into the heart of darkness, let's say, the light started to shine through. 

Moreover, I also came to realize that people often suffer dreadfully. And it's very difficult for a person to suffer dreadfully without getting bitter and resentful. But it doesn't help! All it does is that it makes the suffering worse and spreads it. And so I came to realize that the best way to suffer is to do so with a moral justification in mind. 

"Yes, I'm suffering, but at least I'm learning a valuable lesson out of it and it is that...(whatever it is you should learn from what happened to you)"

And so I adopted that mindset. I told myself, "Look, you are suffering and you have every valid reason to be a complete loser and everyone would excuse you for not being able to pull through. But hey, wouldn't it be nice if you accomplished something remarkable and looked back on this one day and saw that you came out of it with many achievements?". 

And so I did, by the end of that fall semester, I had scored a GPA of 4, founded a community club and had gotten awarded multiple times and by the end of the academic year, I had published my first conference research paper.

Even more, by the end of 2023, I had secured my first internship at the National Bank of Egypt, freelanced as a full-stack developer, and met the Former Minister of Education. 

### Conclusion 

All of this left me more convinced with what Solzhenitsyn said. The only way out of suffering is to have hope. And anyone should strive not to be bitter or resentful when they're suffering. It's the quote written at the footer of this website that I now hold with me anywhere I go. it's the antidote to living a more meaningful life. Yes, you will suffer, but you will also have the opportunity before you to turn your suffering into something remarkable, to reach the stars.

As humans, I believe we can do whatever we set our minds to, and so hopefully, we will set our minds to the right things.
