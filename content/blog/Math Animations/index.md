## Learning Manim


In this blog post, I'll share my experience learning **Manim**, a mathematical animation engine, and how I used it to develop two videos. One focused on the **Distribution Counting Sort** algorithm, and the other on **Neural Networks and Activation Functions**.

## Distribution Counting Sort Visualization

The **Distribution Counting Sort** algorithm is an efficient sorting technique designed specifically for integers with a limited range. It works by counting the occurrences of each element and using those counts to determine the correct positions of the elements in the sorted array.

I developed this visualization as part of my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms course (CS312)**. Over the course of **78 hours**, I created it using **Manim** and polished the final video with background music using **Adobe Premiere Pro**.

## Neural Networks & Activation Functions

For the machine learning course taught at the university with Dr. Ammar Mohamed, I wanted to visualize the process of learning for neural networks and activation functions to better understand it. I think this has to be the better animation that I personally perfer out of the two.
